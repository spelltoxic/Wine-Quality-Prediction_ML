# Wine-Quality-Prediction_ML

Played significant role in critical projects:

Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict the quality
of red wine, enhancing the wine production process.

Data Handling: Preprocessed and managed a dataset with 1599
entries and 12 features, ensuring data consistency and handling
missing values.

Modeling: Implemented and compared algorithms (Logistic
Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors), with Decision
Tree yielding the best performance.

Feature Analysis: Identified key wine quality factors such as fixed
acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and alcohol content.

Outcome: Integrated insights into the wine production process to
improve quality control and decision-making.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
